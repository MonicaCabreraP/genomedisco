# genomedisco
`genomedisco` is a package for comparing contact maps of 3D genome structures, obtained from experiments such as Hi-C, Capture-C, ChIA-PET, HiChip, etc. It uses graph diffusion to smooth contact maps, and then compares them, resulting in a reproducibility score that can be used for quality control of biological replicates.
